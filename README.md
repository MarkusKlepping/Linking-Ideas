# Linking Ideas

## Description

### Problem

A lot of people do not want to share their ideas, because they are afraid that other people will blame them for having an Idea which is bad in their opinion.
On the other side, there are people that would love to share their Ideas but they do not have a platform to do so.
Therefore a lot of really great, creative,small and big ideas are not being published.

### Reason to use Linking Ideas

A special target-group are people who want to start a Start-Up but do not have enough feedback on their idea, nor do they have a possibility to show their Idea on a suiting platform 
Linking Ideas could help getting the needed audience for people who want to go the path of an Enterpreneur and therefore need feedback and/or an Investor.

### Solution

Linking Ideas makes it easy and accessible to share your Idea on a platform which is created exactly for the purpose of receiving feedback and to get in touch with people who have a similar Idea, want to help you or invest in your Idea.
It should take peoples fear to share their ideas and discuss them with other people.

### MVP

* You can signup to the platform and upload as many Ideas as you want which are then shown in a feed.

* You can see every Idea which is being uploaded to the platform and can click each individual to receive more information

* You can edit your Login-Data and Delete your User

* A Menu which helps you navigating through the application

* No Signup required for seeing ideas



### Features that would be nice
 
* Everyone can upload an individual Picture to their Idea

* You can edit your uploaded ideas and reupload them after editing

* An overview of all your uploaded ideas 

* Feed which shows the mos clicked ideas at the top of the Feed


### Challenges

* I did not manage to let users Upload their own pictures to their Ideas

* The Feed was quite some struggle to make it work, as well to have a template with changing data out of the database
